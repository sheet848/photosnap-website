![preview of the site](preview.jpg)

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Coded by [me](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Martin-K-Kamir)! üòÅ

Welcome to the repository for this project. Feel free to look around and explore! üòÄ

### Tools

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

### Development
Like my previous 2 projects, I used the same stack and I can say in every project I saw the mistakes I made in the previous project. Which helped me to improve my code. For the SCSS-generated props & utilities I have built, I can see how easy and fast is to build up the project and with using CUBE the HTML is super clean to read (i think). Also after the 3 projects I have been using, I found a couple of things that should be improved and a couple of bugs to be fixed. After all this website was really fast to build because there are few components to make. I liked how the design was made. I just wished there was provided better quality images.
